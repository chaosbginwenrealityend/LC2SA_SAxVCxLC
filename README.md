# LC2SA_SAxVCxLC
An enlightning re-port
This project when complete will bring a new Liberty City port to San Andreas. My goals and ambitions are:
  1- Recreate the same atmosphire as gta3 in SA i.e, all the effects like smoke, lights and marquees
  2- Upgrade LC with ped attractors
  3- Fix all bugs and collision issues
  4- Repair/rebuild or add rooftops to both HQ models and lods.
  
This project is currently be done for SAxVCxLC on GtaForums.com but this port is and will be open for anyone to use and enjoy.
